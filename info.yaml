project:
  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
  source_files: 
    - full_adder.v
    - tt_um_kris_full_adder.v

  top_module:  "tt_um_kris_full_adder"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 4

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Kristaps Jurkans"      # Your name
  title:        "Example of full adder synthesis using Tiny Tapeout"      # Project title
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Implements a full adder, and exposes the pins to the user."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Calculates the addition of A + B, accounting for any carry-ins and generates a carry out if necessary.
      The Verilog used is: ``{carry_out, c} = a + b + carry_in;``

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Apply values to the inputs, observe the outputs and check if t hey correspond to the full adder truth table provided below.

      | A | B | Carry In | C | Carry Out |
      | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
      | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
      | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
      | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
      | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
